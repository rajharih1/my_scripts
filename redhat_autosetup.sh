A plain comment line has a\n#      whitespace character following the comment indicator.\n#   There are also special comment lines defined below.\n#  A special comment will always have a non-whitespace\n#  character in column 2.\n#\n#    A blank line should be ignored.\n#\n#      The following table shows the corrections that must\n#  be applied to compute International Atomic Time (TAI)\n#        from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) values that\n#  are transmitted by almost all time services.\n#\n#       The first column shows an epoch as a number of seconds\n#       since 1 January 1900, 00:00:00 (1900.0 is also used to\n#       indicate the same epoch.) Both of these time stamp formats\n#      ignore the complexities of the time scales that were\n# used before the current definition of UTC at the start\n#       of 1972. (See note 3 below.)\n# The second column shows the number of seconds that\n#      must be added to UTC to compute TAI for any timestamp\n#        at or after that epoch. The value on each line is\n#    valid from the indicated initial instant until the\n#      epoch given on the next one or indefinitely into the\n# future if there is no next line.\n#     (The comment on each line shows the representation of\n#        the corresponding initial epoch in the usual\n#    day-month-year format. The epoch always begins at\n#    00:00:00 UTC on the indicated day. See Note 5 below.)\n#\n#     Important notes:\n#\n#  1. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is often referred to\n#        as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The GMT time scale is no\n#       longer used, and the use of GMT to designate UTC is\n#  discouraged.\n#\n#      2. The UTC time scale is realized by many national\n#      laboratories and timing centers. Each laboratory\n#     identifies its realization with its name: Thus\n#       UTC(NIST), UTC(USNO), etc. The differences among\n#        these different realizations are typically on the\n#    order of a few nanoseconds (i.e., 0.000 000 00x s)\n#   and can be ignored for many purposes. These differences\n#      are tabulated in Circular T, which is published monthly\n# by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures\n#  (BIPM). See www.bipm.org for more information.\n#\n#    3. The current definition of the relationship between UTC\n#       and TAI dates from 1 January 1972. A number of different\n#     time scales were in use before that epoch, and it can be\n#     quite difficult to compute precise timestamps and time\n#  intervals in those "prehistoric" days. For more information,\n# consult:\n#\n#          The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical\n#               Ephemeris.\n#   or\n#           Terry Quinn, "The BIPM and the Accurate Measurement\n#             of Time," Proc. of the IEEE, Vol. 79, pp. 894-905,\n#           July, 1991.\n#\n#       4. The decision to insert a leap second into UTC is currently\n#   the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation and\n#   Reference Systems Service. (The name was changed from the\n#    International Earth Rotation Service, but the acronym IERS\n#   is still used.)\n#\n#      Leap seconds are announced by the IERS in its Bulletin C.\n#\n# See www.iers.org for more details.\n#\n#        Every national laboratory and timing center uses the\n# data from the BIPM and the IERS to construct UTC(lab),\n#  their local realization of UTC.\n#\n#   Although the definition also includes the possibility\n#        of dropping seconds ("negative" leap seconds), this has\n# never been done and is unlikely to be necessary in the\n#       foreseeable future.\n#\n#       5. If your system keeps time as the number of seconds since\n#  some epoch (e.g., NTP timestamps), then the algorithm for\n#       assigning a UTC time stamp to an event that happens during a positive\n#        leap second is not well defined. The official name of that leap\n#      second is 23:59:60, but there is no way of representing that time\n#       in these systems.\n#    Many systems of this type effectively stop the system clock for\n#      one second during the leap second and use a time that is equivalent\n#     to 23:59:59 UTC twice. For these systems, the corresponding TAI\n#      timestamp would be obtained by advancing to the next entry in the\n#    following table when the time equivalent to 23:59:59 UTC\n#        is used for the second time. Thus the leap second which\n#      occurred on 30 June 1972 at 23:59:59 UTC would have TAI\n#      timestamps computed as follows:\n#\n#   ...\n#     30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599, first time): TAI= UTC + 10 seconds\n#        30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785599,second time): TAI= UTC + 11 seconds\n#        1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600)TAI= UTC + 11 seconds\n# ...\n#\n#       If your system realizes the leap second by repeating 00:00:00 UTC twice\n#      (this is possible but not usual), then the advance to the next entry\n# in the table must occur the second time that a time equivalent to\n#       00:00:00 UTC is used. Thus, using the same example as above:\n#\n#      ...\n#       30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599):                TAI= UTC + 10 seconds\n#       30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785600, first time):     TAI= UTC + 10 seconds\n#       1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600,second time):  TAI= UTC + 11 seconds\n#        ...\n#\n# in both cases the use of timestamps based on TAI produces a smooth\n#    time scale with no discontinuity in the time interval. However,\n#      although the long-term behavior of the time scale is correct in both\n#    methods, the second method is technically not correct because it adds\n#        the extra second to the wrong day.\n#\n#        This complexity would not be needed for negative leap seconds (if they\n#  are ever used). The UTC time would skip 23:59:59 and advance from\n#    23:59:58 to 00:00:00 in that case. The TAI offset would decrease by\n#  1 second at the same instant. This is a much easier situation to deal\n#   with, since the difficulty of unambiguously representing the epoch\n#   during the leap second does not arise.\n#\n#    Some systems implement leap seconds by amortizing the leap second\n#       over the last few minutes of the day. The frequency of the local\n#     clock is decreased (or increased) to realize the positive (or\n#        negative) leap second. This method removes the time step described\n#      above. Although the long-term behavior of the time scale is correct\n#  in this case, this method introduces an error during the adjustment\n#  period both in time and in frequency with respect to the official\n#       definition of UTC.\n#\n#        Questions or comments to:\n#            Judah Levine\n#         Time and Frequency Division\n#          NIST\n#   Boulder, Colorado\n#             Judah.Levine@nist.gov\n#\n#     Last Update of leap second values:   8 July 2016\n#\n#  The following line shows this last update date in NTP timestamp\n#      format. This is the date on which the most recent change to\n#     the leap second data was added to the file.

The Modified Julian Day number\n#    corresponding to the NTP time stamp, X, can be computed as\n#\n#   X/86400 + 15020\n#\n#   where the first term converts seconds to days and the second\n# term adds the MJD corresponding to the time origin defined above.\n#       The integer portion of the result is the integer MJD for that\n#        day, and any remainder is the time of day, expressed as the\n#  fraction of the day since 0 hours UTC. The conversion from day\n#  fraction to seconds or to hours, minutes, and seconds may involve\n#    rounding or truncation, depending on the method used in the\n#  computation.\n#\n#      The data in this file will be updated periodically as new leap\n#  seconds are announced. In addition to being entered on the line\n#      above, the update time (in NTP format) will be added to the basic\n#    file name leap-seconds to form the name leap-seconds.<NTP TIME>.\n#        In addition, the generic name leap-seconds.list will always point to\n# the most recent version of the file.\n#\n#      This update procedure will be performed only when a new leap secondn       is announced.\n#\n#     The following entry specifies the expiration date of the data\n#        in this file in units of seconds since the origin at the instant\n#        1 January 1900, 00:00:00. This expiration date will be changed\n#       at least twice per year whether or not a new leap second is\n#  announced. These semi-annual changes will be made no later\n#      than 1 June and 1 December of each year to indicate what\n#     action (if any) is to be taken on 30 June and 31 December,\n#   respectively.
